## Description

  I created this project to learn React Native, Firebase, and Redux Toolkit, and to improve my front-end JavaScript skills. I built this project because I wanted to familiarize myself with developing an e-commerce application featuring a beautiful UI.

The problems I encountered included handling Clerk authentication, particularly when I updated to Expo 51, which resulted in an error: "Not a valid base64 encoded string length." Additionally, I faced challenges managing Redux Thunk with Firebase and handling data for purchase history.

Through this project, I learned how to integrate Firebase with Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous operations, manage authentication with Clerk, use Redux Toolkit effectively, and implement custom drawer navigation.
